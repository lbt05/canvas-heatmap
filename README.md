Alan's version of Simple Heatmap forked from Sunng's
======================

This is a simple heatmap api based on HTML5 canvas.


More detailed document comming soon.

Currently I have bug for status display, it will shows as ready when first worker return the 'value' hash to heatmap.js
But what I want is that it has to keep as 'rendering' until the last worker returns the 'value' hash.
